This project contains a complete implementation of Linear Regression using Python, following the concepts from the CampusX 100-Days-of-ML series. I recreated the entire workflow on my own machine, understood each step, and organized everything into this dedicated repository.
The goal of this project is to understand:
What Linear Regression is
How to implement it from scratch
How to evaluate a regression model
How to visualize results
How to use it on real datasets
